                        We envision a future where good food will not be wasted and negatively impact the <br>

                        worrying about where their next meal will come from. And where excess food has an easy <br>

                    We are a small group of students who banded together for the sole purpose 
                    of helping to diminish one of the greatest disasters of our time., 
                    food waste. For this reason, we decided to start by helping reduce this
                     phenomenon on the restaurant level.

                         <h2>The food waste crisis</h2>
                        <p>
                            Approximately one third of all food in Romania ends up in the trash or is unnecessarily wasted annually. This amount corresponds to about 2.55 million tons of food products. Unfortunately, waste can be found at all levels of society, from the smallest household to the largest enterprise.
                            Worldwide one in nine people do not have enough food to eat, that’s 793 million people who are undernourished, at the same time if one quarter of the food currently lost or wasted could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people.
                            The food currently wasted in Europe could feed 200 million people, in Latin America 300 million people and in Africa 300 million people.
                            Annual per capita waste by consumers is between 95-115kgs a year for Europeans and North Americans, while in south and southeastern Asia, it is 6-11kgs.
                            In developing countries, 40% of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in developed countries, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels.

                        <p>
                            The discarded food combines with the already existing waste and begins a slow process of decomposition, which releases methane. Methane is one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, 28x stronger than carbon dioxide. Once in the atmosphere, it contributes massively to global warming. 
                            Each product that arrives in front of you has gone through countless stages such as collection, packaging or transport, thus involving the consumption of several resources, the best example being the fuel used for transport and other machinery which as we very well know is one of the great causes of pollution.
                            By mid-century, the world population will hit 9 billion people. By then, food production must be increased by 70% from today’s levels to meet this demand.
                            Food losses translate into lost income for farmers and higher prices for consumers, giving us an economic incentive to reduce food waste.
